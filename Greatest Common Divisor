/* SMALL CHALLENGE: Write a method named getGreatestCommonDivisor with two parameters 
of type int named first and second. If one of the parameters is < 10, the method should
return -1 to indicate an invalid value. The method should return the greatest common 
divisor of the two numbers (int). The greatest common divisor is the largest positive
integer that can fully divide each of the integers (i.e. without leaving a remainder). */

        if(first < 10 || second < 10){

        }

    // A for loop that decrements by 1 to find the greatest common divisor
