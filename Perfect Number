/* SMALL CHALLENGE: A perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its 
proper positive divisors. Write a method named isPerfectNumber with one parameter of type int
named number. If number is < 1, the method should return false. The method must calculate if 
the number is perfect. If the number is perfect, the method should return true; otherwise, 
it should return false. */
